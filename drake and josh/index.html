    <h1>Drake & Josh fanpage</h1>
	<p> i never thought that it'd be so simple but 
i found a way, i found a way
i always thought that it'd be too crazy but 
i found a way, i found a way 

if you open up your mind 
see what's inside
it's gonna take some time, to realize 
but if you look inside, i'm sure you'll find 
over your shoulder you know that, i told you 
i'll always be pickin' you up when you're down 
so just turn around 

now that i know that anything's possible 
i found a way, i found a way 
no one can break what is so unbreakable 
i found a way, i found a way 

if you open up your mind 
see what's inside 
it's gonna take some time, to realize 
but if you look inside, i'm sure you'll find 
over your shoulder you know that, i told you 
i'll always be pickin' you up when you're down 
so just turn around 

no one cares 
what you give 
you know you gotta live like you wanna live 
when it's time 
to be free 
you know you gotta be what you wanna be 

if you open up your mind 
see what's inside 
it's gonna take some time, to realize 
but if you look inside, i'm sure you'll find 
over your shoulder you know that, i told you 
i'll always be pickin' you up when you're down 
so just turn around
