	<p>scratch is a program that allows you to create basic sprite animations on a stage. each sprite has its own scripts, costumes and sounds. each stage has its own script, background and sounds. in this, i used scripts from a <a href="http://www.maplesimulator.com/programs/bannedstory">maplestory script simulator</a> to animate a character killing a mushroom.</p>

	<p>with spencer wright, i created an interactive story that follows the main character as they go through a dilema: should they break up with their lover because they ate their last slice of cake? sprites were taken off of <a href="http://www.maplesimulator.com/programs/bannedstory">maplestory script simulator</a>, and the backlog used to program this can be found <a href="backlog.xlsx" download>here.</a></h4></div>

	<p>
	in my english class, i do biweekly assignments where i read two chapters from a book and write a paper that includes a summary of those two chapters and a short essay following a prompt that correlates with one of the assignments. my partner, joaquin ancona, and i turned this assignment interactive using python, breaking it down and allowing the user to choose what they want to read from my essay.  joaquin and i also made a flowchart to help us with planning, which you can find <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7KY86IwLKJ-RnZ1Y2RFQ2tueTA/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (the flowchart a bit hard to see, so for best results, open the file in draw.io, which is accessible when you hover over the top of the screen).

	<p> brandon demesa and i were assigned a project in which we were assigned to analyze the correlation between crime and unemployment. we took this data from chino hills, ca; los angeles, ca; and new york city, new york and graphed it using python. we concluded that we did that there was no correlation between crime and unemployment. <br> <br> download the file here. </h2></h2>	</p></div>
